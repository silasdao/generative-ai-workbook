Streamlit is a powerful open-source framework used for building web applications with interactive data visualizations and machine learning models. To import Streamlit, you'll need to ensure that you have it installed in your Python environment.
#Once you have Streamlit installed, you can import it into your Python script using the import statement,

import streamlit as st
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

#Function to return the response
def load_answer(question):
    llm = OpenAI(model_name="text-davinci-003",temperature=0)
    return llm(question)


#App UI starts here
st.set_page_config(page_title="LangChain Demo", page_icon=":robot:")
st.header("LangChain Demo")

#Gets the user input
def get_text():
    return st.text_input("You: ", key="input")


user_input=get_text()
response = load_answer(user_input)

if submit := st.button('Generate'):
    st.subheader("Answer:")
